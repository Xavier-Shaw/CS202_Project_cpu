## Introduction
Implementing an single-cycle cpu by FPGA and Verilog. The cpu is of Von-Neumann structure. We constructed several modules including Controller, Decoder, IFetch, Data Memory, ALU, I/O and etc. The I/O module includes LED, Switch and UART. 
The ISA(Instruction Set Architecture) is based on MIPS. And we used Assembly to construct several test scenes.

## Implementation
You can check the introduction and specific requirements in the CS202_Project.pdf.
Also, you can check the code under the `code` directory and our idea in the CS202_Project_Report.pdf.
